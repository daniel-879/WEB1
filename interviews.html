     <br>
     <b>What drew you to Peaky Blinders?</b><br>
     <br>
     Well, I always try and follow the writing and I’ve been a fan of Steven Knight’s work for quite a while and the quality just jumped off the page. It’s just very unusual and very compelling and the character Tom Shelby is kind of an enigma. I haven’t done television in many, many years and there’s kind of a golden age with television now and for actors to get to explore characters over the course of six hours is a real treat, especially when you have writing of that calibre.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>What was the hardest scene for you to film?</b><br>
     <br>
     I’m not a tough guy at all so it was by far the toughest character I have ever portrayed, and him being so physical and the amount of respect and fear that this family has in this town means that we all had to look tough. You've got to commit to the material and commit to the character and his choices. We did a lot of fighting, stunts, and so I’ve been to the gym more than I ever been in my whole life! Also learning to handle horses, as I’ve never really done that before, so I had go and spend weeks learning how to ride and how to look reasonably competent on a horse.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>What did you find were the differences between working on movies and coming back to television?</b><br>
     <br>
     The difference is minimal really in terms of production values and the quality of the crew and everybody working on it, the actors and the script. You have to move faster and work faster but I also enjoy that. When you’re confident in the material and hopefully confident in the character then you can just go at a pace.
